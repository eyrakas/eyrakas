title: Welcome to Sakariya's Data Science Blog
---


This platform is for Data Science knowledge and experience sharing from Sakariya, and is a platform to communicate with like-minded data scientists in Vancouver and beyond. The Data Sceince field and its current global trends provide a foreseable transformation on how humans process data, and extract meaninful intelligence to make critical decisions.

All aspects of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, deep learning and use of neural networks encompass the complexity of the field and how it can massively utilize various different computational platforms.

This is what brings curiosity and eagerness of what technology comes next, how could the world's ever increasing data be used for predictions to drive global markets, climate change, and even more. Please stay tuned as this blog will provide important information on all these aspects on a regular basis. In future, the blog will have a feedback page as well. 

Below is my github repo, you may follow for regular updates on latest trends on the Data Science.
